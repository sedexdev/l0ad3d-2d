<h1>L0ad3ed-2D - A 2D Lua based Loaded (1995, PS1) demo running on the LOVE2D engine</h1>

<p>Project name: L0ad3d-2D</p>
<p>Description:</p> 
<p>This is a conecptual version of the classic 1995
PS1 game 'Loaded'. It features a small demo environment
to emulate the original in a 2D plane using Lua and
the LOVE2D game engine for development. All textures
were created by me using GIMP.</p>
